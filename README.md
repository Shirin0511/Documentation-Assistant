# 📚 Documentation Assistant for GitHub API Docs

A **RAG** system that answers questions about GitHub REST API documentation using vector search with MMR retriever + LLM generation.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end RAG pipeline including:

- Web ingestion
- Header-based structural chunking
- Embeddings
- Vector database indexing
- Retriever design
- Answer generation
- Retrieval quality evaluation
- Latency benchmarking
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework

Designed to reflect **industry RAG architecture patterns** rather than tutorial-level prototypes.

Each layer is independently testable — mirrors production RAG service layering.

# Data Source

Current ingestion source: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues


Easily extensible to multiple documentation sources.

---

# Chunking Strategy (Industry Style)

Instead of naive fixed-size chunking, this system uses:

## Header-Aware Chunking

- Split on H1, H2 and H3 markdown headers
- Aligns with user query intent naturally, since API docs are organized by endpoint/topic

## Size Enforcement

- Target chunk size: ~1200 chars
- Max chunk size: 2000 chars
- Oversized chunks → recursively split
- Small chunks → merged intelligently

## Metadata Added Per Chunk

- To improve retrieval filtering and answer grounding, following parameters were added to the metadata - api_name, source_url, page_title, doc_type, contains_code, header_section

---

# Embeddings

Model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

---

# Vector Store 

Vector DB : Qdrant (local in-memory mode)

---

# Generation Layer - Groq API

---

# Evaluation Implemented

This project includes measurable RAG evaluation.

---

## Retrieval Metric - Hit@K

Measures whether correct doc appears in top-K retrieved chunks.

Example result:

Hit@5 = 75%
Hit@8 = 100%

## Latency Measurement -

Average Retrieval latency = 3.2 seconds

## Groundedness Score - 

Checks if answer is fully supported by retrieved context.

Returns:

1 = grounded
0 = not grounded

## Answer Relevance - 

Measures how well answer addresses user question.

Scale: 1-5

## Answer Completeness - 

Checks whether answer fully addresses question.

Returns:

1 = complete
0 = incomplete

## Hallucination Detection with Multi-Pass Evaluation - 

Detects whether answer introduces information not present in retrieved context.

Instead of single-pass judgement, uses multi-run ( 3 runs) evaluation to calculate avg hallucination score computed and hence reduces LLM noise.

# Future Improvements

- Multi-source ingestion
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense)
- UI interface
